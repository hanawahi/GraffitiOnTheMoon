# GraffitiOnTheMoon
Emily Richardson, Hana Wahi, Alex Furlong, Martha Bohon

This video game and web application were built under 24 hours at AthenaHacks 2020, at the University of Southern California (USC) by Emily, Hana, Alex, and Martha. We used Unity, C# for creating the video game. For the web application, we used Python, Flask Web Framework, Bootstrap. HTML, CSS, and Javascript hosted with Heroku.
Even though it was started at a hackathon, we intend on finishing this project! Development is currently in progress.
